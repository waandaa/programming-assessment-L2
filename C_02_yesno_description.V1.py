Whānau Mārama: New Zealand International Film Festival is a national event to enhance the appreciation of, \n
and engagement with, global art and culture by providing access to a diverse range of high-quality film. \n
A programme of between 150-170 features is presented in Auckland and Wellington. The Festival opens in Auckland \n
one weekend and gets underway in Wellington the next, overlapping for 10 of their respective 17-day seasons. \n
A smaller programme then travels to 11 further centres. The consolidation of several separately evolved Festivals \n
into a single event known as The New Zealand International Film Festival occurred for the first time in 2009. \n
In 2020, the Festival was rebranded Whānau Mārama: New Zealand International Film Festival.  \n
\n
In the process of purchasing your tickets from our selection of 2025 films, you will be asked to select your \n 
Tauranga Cinema after which you will see our selection of films for that Cinema. After choosing what film you'd \n 
like to see, you can choose how many tickets and what age range. You will then be shown a selection of snacks that \n
 you can preorder, and finally you will confirm or deny your purchase. Enjoy! \n
